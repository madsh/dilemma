So it's a story about a father that wants all the the best for his young son.

Dad goes to a store that sells dogs, finds a cute little puppy and pays some money. 

Son gets his a puppy and everybody is happy.

Time passes, the puppy follows the son around all day and grows into a dog. The dog learns new tricks from playing with the son, with Mom and Dad, but also every other dog it meets. Everybody is happy.

One day the dog bites Mom. She is not happy. And now Mom and Dad starts to argue.

"Who is to blame?" (for the dog hurting mom)

Dad looks to Mom... and blame her for getting too close to the dog. She cries back: "I had no idea this dog bites".

Dad looks to the store... they tell him it was a perfectly nice puppy - actually the best of bread.

Dad looks to the son... and ask if the son could have done better. The son cries back: "I tried my best to train the dog to be nice. But I could not keep the the other dogs away".

Finally Dad looks to him self... and asks "Could I have done better?"

(After some thinking, he decides)

He could have chained the dog outside the house. (constrain the domain of the usage of AI)

He could have asked the place with stray dogs for better guidance. (label the intended use and limitations of AI)

He could have spent more time with his son and the dog, watch carefully as the dog grew and evaluate if its was still the right dog for his son. (monitoring if AI evolves to better for a purpose)

Dad looks to the dog and conclude it has changed. He drives out of town and gives the dog away to another store with stray dogs and tells the son that dog run away and he will never see it again.

The son gets very upset and Dad calmly explains: "Your dog grew and learned and it had unintended consequences". But the son knew that Dad took the dog away. Dad admits, but also promise the son a new and better puppy - when he saved up enough money.

Dad goes back to first store asks for his money back. The store owner is not happy and dad starts to argue. The argument continous into court where they both spend worth thousand of puppies to understand what is in the law about puppies.

The son eventually get a new puppy and is happy and dad only lost some money.

(to the divorced men...)
Mom is confused... she was hurt. What does this have to do with chains and store owners? And why was dad away so long. She just wanted to be comforted.

(to governments)
Meanwhile -  at secret facility - the puppy recieves some very specialized training and is renamed to  "autonomous intelligent self learning killer device".

(reaction from a mom)
Tossing something because it didnt work as expected is never the right thing to do... but taking responsibility is a lost art.
